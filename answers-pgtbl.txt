1.
All of the syscalls that get information about the  process can be made faster 
by doing the same thing we did here: allocate a permenant address, and a page on startup that is user read-only 

2.
The first time we call mappages() in exec, is when we call uvmalloc at address 0.
So, page 0 seems to have the elf headers.
But, according figure 3-4, it should be the text segment, so it is possible that the ELF header is considered to be part of that.

Next, exec allocated 2 more pages: 1 & 2
The comments say: 

  // Allocate two pages at the next page boundary.
  // Make the first inaccessible as a stack guard.
  // Use the second as the user stack.

so, the first page is not accessible by the user
and the second is the stack!

according to figure 3-4, the third to last page is the final page of the heap, followed by the second to last page which is the trapframe.
